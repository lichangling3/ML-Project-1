# CS-433 - Machine learning projet 1

## Introduction
The aim of this project is to learn to use the concepts of machine learning presented in the lectures and practiced in the labs on a
real-world dataset, in the context of a recent popular machine learning challenge - finding the Higgs boson -, using original data from CERN~\cite{higgs}. For any further information on this machine learning challenge and its dataset, feel free to consult the [original paper] (https://higgsml.lal.in2p3.fr/files/2014/04/documentation_v1.8.pdf).

## Organisation
This project is organized as follows :

- the repository *src* that includes: 
    - *proj1_helpers.py* which contains the helper functions provided by the Professor
    - *implementations.py* which contains all the other functions coded by ourselves used to create this machine learning system
    - *project1.ipynb* is the jupyter notebook with all the steps of this machine learning project
- the file *run.py* which produces exactly the same .csv predictions we used in our best submission to the competition system
- the file *CS-433_project1_report.pdf* which is our report that provides a full explanation of our ML system and our findings, made by using LaTeX.

## How to use our project
Just make sure to have the libraries mentioned below installed on your environment before running the cells in the jupyter notebook.

## Libraries
In this project we used a few libraries other than NumPy for vizualisation purposes : 
- matplotlib.pyplot
- seaborn
